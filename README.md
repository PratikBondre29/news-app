# **Voice Assistant News App using React**

- ### It's basically a voice-assistant news app where user can read any news.

---

- ### Either user can search the news by using searchbox or by using the voice search feature that I've provided.

---

- ### And user can read different categories of news as I have provided different options to user in *Navbar*.

---

- ### For the news data, I've used NewsAPI

  - [NewsAPI.org API](https://newsapi.org/)

  ***

- ### For the voice search feature , I've used speech-recognition i.e. a npm package
  - [speech-recognition API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-speech-recognition)

---

- ### I guess the free plan simply is not longer available in production that's why I haven't deployed the app.
