# **Voice Assistant News App using React**

- ### It's basically a voice-assistant news app where user can read any news.

---

- ### Either user can search the news by using searchbox or by using the voice search feature that I've provided.

---

- ### And user can read different categories of news as we have provided different options to user in navbar.

---

- ### For the news data, I've used NewsAPI

  - [NewsAPI.org API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/ai-face-detection)

  ***

- ### For the voice search feature , I've used speech-recognition i.e. npm package
  - [speech-recognition API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/ai-face-detection)

- ### React app is deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
